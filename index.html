    <h1>The Muslim has six rights over another Muslim.</h1>
    <div>
    The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'The Muslim has six rights over another Muslim.
     It was said to him: 'O' Allah's Messenger, what are these?' Thereupon he said:
 When you meet him, offer him greetings;
 When he invites you to a feast, accept it;
 When he seeks your counsel (advice), give it to him;
 When he sneezes and says: "All praise is due to Allah," you say "Yarhamuk-Allah" (may Allah show mercy to you);
 When he falls sick, visit him
 And when he dies, follow his bier (Janazah). (Hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah in Sahih Muslim)
